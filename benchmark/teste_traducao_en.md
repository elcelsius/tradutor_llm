It was supposed to be a simple revenge.

Heroes and villains, gods and monsters — they all like to pretend we're in the same neat little story. We're not. I'm not some chosen hero with a shining destiny. I'm just a guy who got stepped on too many times and finally decided to bite back.

The priests in their golden robes called her the Radiant Goddess of Dawn. I called her something else the day she burned my village down.

"One day," I whispered, watching the flames chew through my home, "I'm coming for you. And when I do, I'm not stopping halfway."

That promise has been the only thing keeping me moving ever since. Not justice. Not hope. Just spite. Cold, patient spite.

"You're doing this for revenge again, aren't you?" asked Marla, walking beside me on the forest path. She kicked a loose stone, sending it skittering down the slope. "You know nothing good ever comes out of that."

"Good?" I laughed. "Good left town the day the Goddess turned my life into kindling. I'm not doing this for good. I'm doing this because I refuse to let her laugh about it for the rest of eternity."

A small ball of purple slime poked its head out of my cloak and let out a cheerful squeak.

"Squee!"

"Not you too," Marla groaned. "Don't encourage him."

I glanced at the slime. "What do you think, Piggymaru? Want to help me pick a fight with a so-called divine being who thinks mortals are disposable?"

"Squee!" The slime wobbled, turning a brighter shade of violet. That was his "yes" color. Probably. I was still working out the system.

"You two are insane," Marla muttered. "Completely, absolutely insane."

"Insane," I said, "is charging into a holy war because a shiny voice in the sky told you you're 'the chosen one'. I'm not chosen. I'm just angry. There's a difference."

We walked deeper into the forest. Branches cracked under our boots. Somewhere far above the leaves, the Goddess's precious sun was rising again, like nothing was wrong.

"They say revenge never ends well," Marla added after a while.

"They're right," I replied. "Nothing good ever comes from it. I don't want anything good out of this. I just want her to know that one miserable little human refused to stay crushed under her heel."

I stopped and looked up between the trees, imagining her throne of light, her smug, perfect smile.

"Once I'm ready," I said softly, "I'm coming for you. And I won't stop until you fall."

The slime quivered, glowing brighter.

"Squee."

"Yeah," I whispered. "I'm counting on you too, little guy."

Somewhere very far away, I hoped the so-called Goddess felt a shiver crawl down her spine — the tiny, nagging feeling that one of her toys might be stupid enough to bite back.

"Enjoy your dawn while you can," I added under my breath. "Because I'm coming to ruin your sunrise, you radiant fraud."
