Prologue SOGOU AYAKA PARRIED THE BLOW of Banewolf’s sword, sending a

heavy shockwave down her spear and into her arms. Even against a huge man

such as Banewolf, she didn’t feel overwhelmed—perhaps because of her stat

modifiers.

But now comes the real test! There’s no guarantee he’s going to play

fair. I have to read his next move, and—

“Wah?!” Ayaka was knocked back hard, crashing bottom-first to the

ground.

H-he took my legs out from under me?! But I never even saw—

She looked up to see Suou Kayako standing over her, looking sheepish

and guilty at what she’d just done. Banewolf patted his shoulder with the flat

of his training sword.

“It’s good that you’re being careful, watching for what comes next…

but you couldn’t predict Suou would attack you from behind, eh?”

“I’m sorry…” said Kayako, lowering her head.

“Bwa ha ha!” Banewolf laughed dryly as he reached his hand down to

Ayaka. “What are you apologizin’ for? You were only doin’ what I told you

to, Suou-chan!”

Ayaka accepted his hand and he helped her back to her feet. A few

moments earlier, she would have thought it impossible that her friend Suou

Kayako would sweep her legs out from under her, but…

Should she really have been so sure?

He’s trying to tell me that I should always account for the unexpected.

“You’re trying to teach me not to discount any possibility?” she asked.

“Oho! I didn’t even need to come out and say it plain, did I? Promising

student as ever, ain’t you, Sogou… Phew, I’ve worked up a thirst!” Banewolf

said, grabbing a bottle of ale from the table.

“I wonder if alcohol intake during exercise is advisable…” cautioned Ayaka.

Banewolf ignored her and brought the drink to his lips. “Serious one,

aren’t you? Just like the chief, always complaining about something.”

“You belong to the Monster Slayer Knights, don’t you, Banewolfsan ?” asked Ayaka.

“Call me Bane, it’s shorter.”

“Bane-san, do you belong to—”

“The knight stuff is just for show. It’s important to Ulza that everyone

sees me as some knight of the realm, y’see.” He happily gulped down the rest

of his drink before continuing. “The Monster Slayer King of Ulza’s a

sniveling coward…which lets me relax, living the good life most o’ the time.
But I’ve gotta fulfill my role every now and then, don’t I? Show them I’ve

still got what it takes when push comes to shove.”

Banewolf turned to look at Sogou’s group, pointing the tip of his sword

toward them.

“How about we move on to your battle formation? There’s strategy

here…so let’s put S-class Sogou-chan in the center, right? Let’s get started.” “Excuse me, but why…?”

During the next break from training, Ayaka went to talk with

Banewolf. Her gaze was on Kayako and the others as she wiped the sweat

from her brow with a white cloth.

“Mmm?”

“Why did you offer to instruct us, Bane-san?”

“It’s simple, ain’t it? I just don’t want you to die. The heroes from

another world are our trump card against the Demon King’s armies. If you

guys kick the bucket, I gotta say goodbye to the easy life.”

I guess teaching us is some sort of self-preservation.

“Look, they only called me out here because the Demon King’s on the

move, yeah? Geez, the root of all evil’s a real pain in the neck,” Banewolf

grinned and stroked his beard. “…The Goddess did look a bit annoyed when

I volunteered though, eh? I bet she had her reasons for shorting you an instructor, Sogou. Never can quite figure out what that Goddess is thinking.”

He turned his eyes to Yasu’s group. Yasu Tomohiro was sitting crosslegged in a chair with his back to them, while the rest of them milled around

idly nearby.

“I’d really like to start training that lot too, even just the basics…” said

Banewolf, thinking back to their first day of training.
◁◀ It happened on the first day of their training. Banewolf offered a

handshake and Yasu brushed it away without a second thought.

“What’s with that high-and-mighty attitude?!” Yasu shouted,

motioning again for Banewolf to leave. “Looking down on me, are you? Me,

the ‘Hero of the Black Inferno?!’ They call you Dragonslayer?! Fool! I need no assistance from the likes of you! Nobody in my group does, either! Get

that through your thick skull! Now begone!”

Banewolf just scratched his head and grinned back at him wryly before

replying, “I didn’t mean to come off arrogant or nothing… I’m not too good

at manners and formalities and all that, y’know—back in Ulza, they’re

always chewin’ me out for it. Well, I’ll try to know my place in the future.”

Ayaka watched the exchange, thinking, He wasn’t upset by what Yasu said. He’s being an adult… There’s a lot I could learn from him.
▶▷ And since Yasu had rejected Banewolf’s help, Ayaka now had ample

opportunity to be his student.

Her Kisou style of ancient martial arts was well suited to real combat

situations—but form alone though was not enough. Training was not the

same as the battlefield, and Banewolf had plenty of experience with real

fighting. He knew about life-or-death struggle, and he had many lessons on

how to survive it. That’s likely what the Goddess meant when she talked about technique and the art of battle.

Ayaka looked to the rest of her group, who were wiping the sweat from

their foreheads. Survive… Yes. All of us will survive this…

Their training grounds were now divided in two, split by a high wall

down the middle. Sogou Ayaka, Yasu Tomohiro, and Kirihara Takuto’s

groups were in one half, and in the other were Ikusaba Asagi’s group and the Takao sisters.

There must be some reason they divided us up like this…

Kirihara’s group clearly didn’t think much of Asagi, and it seemed

unlikely they would get along. Putting them together in the same training

grounds was a recipe for trouble.

I can see why they split those groups up…but the Takao sisters? Does

the Goddess not want me talking to them?

Hijiri had been the only other student to speak up against the Goddess.

It would make sense to avoid putting two rebellious elements together.

Is that what she’s planning? Come to think of it, Kirihara-kun and his

group have been acting differently toward Hijiri-san too...

There was something restless about Kirihara’s corner of the training

grounds, something that didn’t start just recently. It all began on the first day

of their training together.
◁◀ “Let me reintroduce myself,” said the eldest brother on their first day

of training with Kirihara Takuto’s group. “The name’s Agit of the Four Holy Elders. You’re in charge of this group, right? Looking forward to working

with you.”

Kirihara was sitting on a bench in the center of the training grounds,

his legs spread apart assertively, leaning forward on the hilt of his sword

which was stuck point-first into the ground before him. Oyamada Shougo sat

by his side, the rest of his group behind them.
“You… You lot strong?” Shougo asked.
“I figure so, yeah?” answered Agit.

“Stronger than those Elite Five, or whoever?”

“Never fought them before, so I couldn’t say.” Agit’s expression was

gentle, but he looked down to see Kirihara glaring up at him.

“Focus. Give it some thought,” Kirihara said.

“Hmm? What do you mean, exactly?” asked Agit.

“You’re just another obstacle for us.”

“Obstacle…?”

Kirihara looked away and gave an exasperated sigh. “I hear stories

about these heroic blood warriors. You one of them?”

“I guess I am, yeah.”

“Then at the end of the day, you’re lower than us heroes. Cut-rate.

Defective.”

“Hmm, you don’t mince words, do you? That bites.”

“I also question the need to speak such harsh truths, but… In the future

I won’t be able to restrain myself from surpassing you in every way.”

Agit looked back at his siblings. His sister, the older of the two,

shrugged her shoulders. Kirihara placed his sword under his arm and tapped

at the air in front of him with his index finger.

“A wall. Right in front of you, there’s a wall you can’t see. In other

words, an obstacle which is going to stunt your growth… But—” Kirihara

stretched out his arm. “Dragonic Buster.”

The golden beam of light streamed past the Four Holy Elders in an instant, followed by a sonic boom. The air swirled around them from the

pressure wave, ruffling their hair before the light evaporated a short distance

from the training ground wall. Kirihara’s unique skill was now level 3, and he

had learned to control its power and range with startling precision.

“I’m the greatest S-class hero there is, and I’ve still got room to grow.

To break through such obstacles… Understand now, second-rate heroes?”

said Kirihara, his arm still stretched out toward them.

“I see. You mean to say that you heroes from another world are a level above us, right? Hmm, but you know…”

There was a sound, like the wind had been sliced in two. For a

moment, everyone was frozen in place until Oyamada was the first to break

the silence.

“Ah?! Y-you little… When did you get over there?! Is this a

declaration of war or what?!”

A blade was pressed to Kirihara’s neck.

It was Agit’s.
The elder smiled weakly, ignoring Oyamada’s howls and bringing his

face closer to Kirihara’s. “When there’s still this much of a power gap

between us…are you sure that’s the attitude you want to take?”

Even though he’d been caught off-guard, Kirihara stayed

expressionless and quiet. Finally, he turned his stare to Agit.

“These shallow displays of power are so childish. You’re one step

short of complete irrelevance, you know? Ready for the fall. You do

understand that, don’t you?”

Agit looked surprised. He withdrew his blade and pulled back.

“Hmm… Quite the balls you’ve got there, eh? I’m looking forward to

training you more than I expected. You pass, Takuto Kirihara.”

“You’re that desperate to deny it?”

Agit grinned happily. “You’re funny, Kirihara.”

Ayaka’s heart was beating out of her chest at the sight.

The way he moved just now… I didn’t even see him draw his blade.

She felt she could see it now—the gap in their abilities that couldn’t be

filled with experience points and stat modifiers alone. Just as the training

grounds were beginning to settle back down…

“Arrogant bunch of kids we’ve got here, eh?!”

The eldest sister of the Four Holy Elders—her black ponytail swishing

around behind her—put everyone on edge again. Abis Angun was taller than

her brother and had a stronger build, with a face just as beautiful as his.

Despite this, she radiated a nervous energy.
Abis lazily wore her ceremonial robes open at the chest—enough that

it attracted a lot of attention. Whenever she walked, her breasts would sway

as if they were ready to pop out at any moment. The boys were mesmerized

by her.

I could never wear clothes like those… Never in a million years.

“Ki-ri-ha-raa-?” Abis bared her teeth aggressively as she stepped

toward him. “What was that about shallow displays of power? You’re firing

off your freakin’ skill to show off too, huh?”

Kirihara cracked his neck, unamused.
“You’re way off mark. In my case, there was nothing shallow about

it.”

“Hmm? Then you won’t mind if I come make sure now, will y—”

“Hey, hey, hey!” Oyamada interrupted, stepping in front of Abis. “I

ain’t lettin’ you talk to Takuto like that and ignore me, got it? Who made you

queen of the world anyway, huh, Captain Mammaries?! Listen here! We’re

high-level heroes, yeah? I don’t know what the deal is with you Four Holey

Smell-ders, but chill with the attitude! Got that? Don’t let your head get

bigger than your tits!” Emboldened by Kirihara’s cool composure, Oyamada kept going.

“You think we gave a bad first impression or what? Once we smash that

freakin’ Demon King and his armies, I’m gonna come back here just to bully

you! Got it?!”

Poke, poke, poke.

Oyamada’s finger jabbed into Abis’ chest, but she didn’t react to it at

all, instead baring her teeth at him and grinning wickedly. Her right hand

moved to grab his index finger.

Poke, poke…snap!

“Gyaaahhh!” ▶▷ “Sulking again like a little kid, are ya, Oyamada?” Abis gave him a mocking smile.

“…Shut up. I’ll kill you.” “You say you’ll kill people all the time, little man. That’s s’posed to

scare me?”

“Huh? One more word, and I’ll use my freakin’ unique skill to—”

“To embarrass yourself again?”

“Ugh…” Oyamada groaned and remembered what happened when he

used his unique skill, right after she’d broken his finger. She dodged all of his

attacks, then broke another finger for good measure.

When the Goddess Vicius learned of the incident, she only smiled and said, “Oh, I suppose that was inevitable.” It was considered a part of their

training.

“You’re crazy! I’m gonna make you cry someday, hear me?”

“I’m sorry, what was that? Want me to break another one?”

Oyamada exhaled but didn’t move to attack—he couldn’t.

The difference in power between them was clear. The Four Holy

Elders were strong—overwhelmingly so. Kirihara, on the other hand, was

quietly training with Agit.

“You’re smarter than Oyamada, I see, Kirihara,” he said.

“I use what I can…take every last thing that my enemy has to offer. I haven’t forgotten you and your siblings’ unimaginative behavior, though. A

day will come when I test you… Be prepared.”

“Hmm… Not gonna get bored with you and Oyamada around, are

we?”

The door to the training grounds opened suddenly. Asagi’s group

walked in, followed by the Takao sisters, the Sabre-Toothed Tigers, and

finally…

“It appears your training is going as planned! Thank you ever so much.”

…the Goddess Vicius.

“So long as you can accomplish the goals I set forth, I leave the instruction up to you. I can hardly ignore method and practice, but what is

most important are results. I can’t possibly complain if you give me results

now, can I? They are the only reliable measure, one might say.”

“To what do we owe this visit, Vicius?” asked Agit.

Ayaka wondered the same. Since the Goddess had gathered all the

heroes from the other half of the training grounds, it must be something

important.

“Right now, I’m having you all develop practical combat skills as a

matter of urgency… But of course, you need to continue leveling up as well.”

She placed a hand on her cheek and sighed. “But alas…Alion’s ruins are all

but spent. There are only a few golden-eyed monsters left to be killed in the

dungeons. That simply won’t do.”

Kirihara directed the point of his training sword at the Goddess.

“Finally time to start touring the other countries’ ruins then?”

“With the Demon King’s armies on the move, I’m afraid we don’t have

time for leisurely field trips. We shall set out tomorrow…” said the Goddess,

bringing her hands together and smiling widely, “…for the Land of the

Golden-Eyed Monsters.”


-------------------------------------



It was supposed to be a simple revenge.

Heroes and villains, gods and monsters — they all like to pretend we're in the same neat little story. We're not. I'm not some chosen hero with a shining destiny. I'm just a guy who got stepped on too many times and finally decided to bite back.

The priests in their golden robes called her the Radiant Goddess of Dawn. I called her something else the day she burned my village down.

"One day," I whispered, watching the flames chew through my home, "I'm coming for you. And when I do, I'm not stopping halfway."

That promise has been the only thing keeping me moving ever since. Not justice. Not hope. Just spite. Cold, patient spite.

"You're doing this for revenge again, aren't you?" asked Marla, walking beside me on the forest path. She kicked a loose stone, sending it skittering down the slope. "You know nothing good ever comes out of that."

"Good?" I laughed. "Good left town the day the Goddess turned my life into kindling. I'm not doing this for good. I'm doing this because I refuse to let her laugh about it for the rest of eternity."

A small ball of purple slime poked its head out of my cloak and let out a cheerful squeak.

"Squee!"

"Not you too," Marla groaned. "Don't encourage him."

I glanced at the slime. "What do you think, Piggymaru? Want to help me pick a fight with a so-called divine being who thinks mortals are disposable?"

"Squee!" The slime wobbled, turning a brighter shade of violet. That was his "yes" color. Probably. I was still working out the system.

"You two are insane," Marla muttered. "Completely, absolutely insane."

"Insane," I said, "is charging into a holy war because a shiny voice in the sky told you you're 'the chosen one'. I'm not chosen. I'm just angry. There's a difference."

We walked deeper into the forest. Branches cracked under our boots. Somewhere far above the leaves, the Goddess's precious sun was rising again, like nothing was wrong.

"They say revenge never ends well," Marla added after a while.

"They're right," I replied. "Nothing good ever comes from it. I don't want anything good out of this. I just want her to know that one miserable little human refused to stay crushed under her heel."

I stopped and looked up between the trees, imagining her throne of light, her smug, perfect smile.

"Once I'm ready," I said softly, "I'm coming for you. And I won't stop until you fall."

The slime quivered, glowing brighter.

"Squee."

"Yeah," I whispered. "I'm counting on you too, little guy."

Somewhere very far away, I hoped the so-called Goddess felt a shiver crawl down her spine — the tiny, nagging feeling that one of her toys might be stupid enough to bite back.

"Enjoy your dawn while you can," I added under my breath. "Because I'm coming to ruin your sunrise, you radiant fraud."
